<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
  This homemade hot and sour soup (tom yum) is easier than most recipes you will
  find. I have simplified a sometimes complex recipe for those like me who can
  have a hard time finding some of the original ingredients. This is my favorite
  recipe, better than any tom yum in the many restaurants I have been to.
